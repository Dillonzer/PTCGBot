PTCGBot is created and based off of [MTGBot](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/MTGBot). So in Twitch Chat when a user requests a card, it will show them the card text for that card!

## Commands
### !card
This is to be used to look up the specific card text. Example: `!card fst mew vmax`

### !cardhelp
This is used to show you how to use the !card command.
